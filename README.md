# Digitalization of Evidence of Insurability Form

## Description
> [!NOTE]
. ***Capstone project for UST-Xpanxion / MMC SIU April - Sep 2023***

This project focuses on enhancing the user experience when filling out the Evidence of Insurability form (EOI). 

EOI is an application process through which the user, usually a new employee in a company, provides information on the condition of their health or their dependent's health in order to be considered for certain types of insurance coverage. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of providing insurance coverage for the user.

Currently, the form been used by the client is a simple paper-based form that is mailed or emailed to the user, the form then will be pass to the insurance company. Because the form is oversimplified the insurance company must follow up with the user to obtain aditional information. 

With the digitalization of this form we are making the process more efficient and less time consumign for all parties envolve.

At this time the form contains 26 main questions and more than 400 follow up questions. 

While the primary goal of this project is the integration of this form into an existing application, for the context current context, a dedicated homepage and profile page were created.
